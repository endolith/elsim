def honest_rankings(utilities):
    """
    Convert utilities into rankings using honest strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    utilities : array_like
        A 2D collection of utilities.

        Rows represent voters, and columns represent candidate IDs.
        Higher utility numbers mean greater approval of that candidate by that
        voter.

    Returns
    -------
    election : array_like
        A collection of ranked ballots.
        Rows represent voters and columns represent rankings, from best to
        worst, with no tied rankings.
        Each cell contains the ID number of a candidate, starting at 0.

        For example, if a voter ranks Curie > Avogadro > Bohr, the ballot line
        would read ``[2, 0, 1]`` (with IDs in alphabetical order).

    Examples
    --------
    Generate an election with 4 voters and 3 candidates:

    >>> from elsim.elections import random_utilities
    >>> utilities = random_utilities(4, 3, random_state=1984)  # for doctest
    >>> utilities
    array([[0.19746307, 0.00903803, 0.78376658],
           [0.08090381, 0.50265116, 0.55887602],
           [0.74867306, 0.21977523, 0.12586929],
           [0.64267652, 0.15365841, 0.77633876]])

    Here, Voter 3 prefers Candidate 2, then 0, then 1, as we can see when
    converted to rankings:

    >>> honest_rankings(utilities)
    array([[2, 0, 1],
           [2, 1, 0],
           [0, 1, 2],

    # use uint8 to save memory.
    if n_cands > 255:
        raise ValueError('Maximum number of candidates is 255')

    # Higher utilities for a voter are ranked first (earlier in row)
    return np.argsort(utilities)[:, ::-1].astype(np.uint8)


def honest_normed_scores(utilities, max_score=5):
    """
    Convert utilities into scores using honest (but normalized) strategy.

    Given a set of utilities for each voter-candidate pair, each voter is
    modeled as giving their favorite candidate a maximum score, least favorite
    candidate a minimum score, and proportional scores in between.

    Parameters
    ----------
    utilities : array_like
        A 2D collection of utilities.

        Rows represent voters, and columns represent candidate IDs.
        Higher utility numbers mean greater approval of that candidate by that
        voter.

    max_score : int, optional
        The highest score on the ballot. If `max_score` = 3, the possible
        scores are 0, 1, 2, 3.

    Returns
    -------
    election : ndarray
        A 2D collection of score ballots.

        Rows represent voters, and columns represent candidate IDs.
        A cell contains a high score if that voter approves of that candidate,
        or low score if they disapprove

    Examples
    --------
    Voter 0 loves Candidates A (index 0) and B (index 1), but hates C (2).
    Voter 1 dislikes A, likes B, and loves C.
    Voter 2 hates A, and is lukewarm about B and C.

    ...              ]

    favorite scored at the max and min:

def approval_optimal(utilities):
    """
    Convert utilities to optimal approval voting ballots.

    Given a set of utilities for each voter-candidate pair, each voter is
    modeled as maximizing their expected utility, by approving any candidate
    that exceeds their mean utility over all candidates. [1]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    utilities : array_like
        A 2D collection of utilities.

        Rows represent voters, and columns represent candidate IDs.
        Higher utility numbers mean greater approval of that candidate by that
        voter.

    Returns
    -------
    election : ndarray
        A 2D collection of approval ballots.

        Rows represent voters, and columns represent candidate IDs.
        A cell contains 1 if that voter approves of that candidate,
        otherwise 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    utilities : array_like

    k : int or 'half'
        The number of candidates approved of by each voter, or 'half' to make

        Rows represent voters, and columns represent candidate IDs.
