def ranked_election_to_matrix(election):
    """
    Convert a ranked election to a pairwise comparison matrix.

    Each entry in the matrix gives the total number of votes obtained by the
    row candidate over the column candidate. [1]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    election : array_like
        A collection of ranked ballots.
        Rows represent voters and columns represent rankings, from best to
        worst, with no tied rankings.
        Each cell contains the ID number of a candidate, starting at 0.

        For example, if a voter ranks Curie > Avogadro > Bohr, the ballot line
        would read ``[2, 0, 1]`` (with IDs in alphabetical order).

    Returns
    -------
    matrix : ndarray
        A pairwise comparison matrix of candidate vs candidate defeats.

        For example, a ``3`` in row 2, column 5, means that 3 voters preferred
        Candidate 2 over Candidate 5.  Candidates are not preferred over
        themselves, so the diagonal is all zeros.

    Examples
    --------
    Label some candidates:

    >>> A, B, C = 0, 1, 2

    Specify the ballots for the 5 voters:

    >>> election = [[A, C, B],
    ...             [A, C, B],
    ...             [B, C, A],
    ...             [B, C, A],
    ...             [C, A, B],
    ...             ]

    Convert to a matrix:

    >>> ranked_election_to_matrix(election)
    array([[0, 3, 2],
           [2, 0, 2],
           [3, 3, 0]], dtype=...)

    This shows that Candidate
    A (row 0) is preferred over B (column 1) by 3 voters.
    C (row 2) is preferred over A (column 0) by 3 voters.
    C (row 2) is preferred over B (column 1) by 3 voters.
