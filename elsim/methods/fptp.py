def fptp(election, tiebreaker=None):
    """
    Find the winner of an election using first-past-the-post / plurality rule.

    The candidate with the largest number of first preferences wins. [1]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    election : array_like
        A 2D collection of ranked ballots.  (See `borda` for election format.)
        Or a 1D array of first preferences only.
    tiebreaker : {'random', 'order', None}, optional
        If there is a tie, and `tiebreaker` is ``'random'``, a random finalist
        is returned.
        If 'order', the lowest-ID tied candidate is returned.
        By default, ``None`` is returned for ties.

    Returns
    -------
    winner : int
        The ID number of the winner, or ``None`` for an unbroken tie.

    Examples
    --------
    Label some candidates:

    >>> A, B, C = 0, 1, 2

    Specify the ballots for the 5 voters:

    >>> election = [[A, C, B],
    ...             [A, C, B],
    ...             [B, A, C],
    ...             [B, C, A],
    ...             [B, C, A],
    ...             [C, A, B],
    ...             ]

    Candidate B (1) gets the most first-preference votes, and is the winner:

    >>> fptp(election)
    1

    Single-mark ballots can also be tallied (with ties broken as specified):

    >>> election = [A, B, B, C, C]
    >>> print(fptp(election))
    None

    There is a tie between B (1) and C (2).  ``tiebreaker=order`` always
    prefers the lower-numbered candidate in a tie:

    >>> fptp(election, 'order')
    1

def sntv(election, n=1, tiebreaker=None):
    """
    Find winners of an election using the single non-transferable vote rule.

    This is a multi-winner generalization of `fptp`.
    The candidates with the largest number of first preferences win. [1]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    election : array_like
        A 2D collection of ranked ballots.  (See `borda` for election format.)
        Or a 1D array of first preferences only.
    tiebreaker : {'random', 'order', None}, optional
        If there is a tie, and `tiebreaker` is ``'random'``, random tied
        candidates are returned.
        If 'order', the lowest-ID tied candidates are returned.
        By default, ``None`` is returned for ties.

    Returns
    -------
    winner : set
        The ID numbers of the winners, or ``None`` for an unbroken tie.

    Examples
    --------
    Label some candidates:

    >>> A, B, C, D = 0, 1, 2, 3

    Specify the ballots for the 5 voters:

    >>> election = [[A, C, B],

    ...             [C, A, B],
    ...             ]

    Candidate B (1) gets the most first-preference votes, and Candidate A (0)
    comes in second.  If SNTV is electing two candidates, A and B will win:

    >>> sntv(election, 2)
    {0, 1}

    Single-mark ballots can also be tallied (with ties broken as specified):

    >>> election = [A, A, B, B, C, C, D]
    >>> print(sntv(election, 2))
    None

    There is a tie between A (0), B (1) and C (2), and no tiebreaker is
    specified.  If instead we use ``tiebreaker=order``, it always prefers the
    lower-numbered candidates in a tie:
