def coombs(election, tiebreaker=None):
    """
    Find the winner of an election using Coomb's method.

    If any candidate gets a majority of first-preference votes, they win.
    Otherwise, the candidate(s) with the most number of last-preference votes
    is eliminated, votes for eliminated candidates are transferred according to
    the voters' preference rankings, and a series of runoff elections are held
    between the remainders until a candidate gets a majority. [1]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    election : array_like
        A collection of ranked ballots.  See `borda` for election format.
        Currently, this must include full rankings for each voter.
    tiebreaker : {'random', None}, optional
        If there is a tie, and `tiebreaker` is ``'random'``, tied candidates
        are eliminated or selected at random
        is returned.
        If 'order', the lowest-ID tied candidate is preferred in each tie.
        By default, ``None`` is returned if there are any ties.

    Returns
    -------
    winner : int
        The ID number of the winner, or ``None`` for an unbroken tie.

    Examples
    --------
    Label some candidates:

    >>> A, B, C = 0, 1, 2

    Specify the ballots for the 5 voters:

    >>> election = [[A, C, B],
    ...             [A, C, B],
    ...             [B, C, A],
    ...             [B, C, A],
    ...             [C, A, B],
    ...             ]

    In the first round, no candidate gets a majority, so Candidate B (1) is
    eliminated, with 3 out of 5 last-place votes.  Voter 2 and 3's
    support of B is transferred to Candidate C (2), causing
    Candidate C to win, with 3 out of 5 votes:
