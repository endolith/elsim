"""
Show the winner distributions and bias of different voting methods with uniform
distribution of voters and candidates.

Similar to Figure 3

The distributions of the winning position with k = 3, 4, 5 candidates and
continuous 1-Euclidean voters (both uniformly distributed) under plurality and
IRV.
