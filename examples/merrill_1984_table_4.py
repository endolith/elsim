(201 voters, 5 candidates)

from

S. Merrill III, "A Comparison of Efficiency of Multicandidate
Electoral Systems", American Journal of Political Science, vol. 28,
no. 1, pp. 23-48, 1984.  :doi:`10.2307/2110786`

(Not including random society column)

Typical result with 100_000 elections:

| Disp      |   1.0 |   1.0 |   1.0 |   1.0 |   0.5 |   0.5 |   0.5 |   0.5 |

| Dims      |     2 |     4 |     2 |     4 |     2 |     4 |     2 |     4 |
|:----------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Plurality |  72.1 |  79.1 |  80.4 |  92.4 |   4.0 |   6.3 |  25.2 |  52.9 |
| Runoff    |  90.5 |  94.2 |  92.0 |  97.5 |  36.6 |  43.6 |  53.3 |  75.3 |
| Hare      |  91.7 |  94.7 |  94.3 |  98.4 |  46.4 |  57.7 |  58.7 |  83.6 |
| Approval  |  96.2 |  97.0 |  96.8 |  98.5 |  95.6 |  96.8 |  95.8 |  98.0 |
| Borda     |  97.8 |  98.6 |  98.3 |  99.4 |  96.6 |  97.7 |  97.4 |  99.0 |
| Coombs    |  97.0 |  97.5 |  97.7 |  98.7 |  94.0 |  94.3 |  95.0 |  96.7 |
| Black     |  97.3 |  97.8 |  98.0 |  99.0 |  95.5 |  96.1 |  96.5 |  98.0 |

Many of these values match the paper closely, but some are consistently off by
up to 9%.
